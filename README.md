# Predicting Endometriosis with K-Nearest Neighbors
- KNN implementation for prediction of endometriosis based on a Kaggle dataset (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelanietie/endometriosis-dataset/data))
- Exploratory Data Analysis
   - includes visualizations of data relationships through heatmap and scatterplot
   - no correlation apparent
- Data Preparation
   - provides two methods of feature scaling (max-min normalization, standardization)
   - gives formula for best number of nearest neighbors
- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
   - weighted, using Euclidean distance
- Evaluation
   - Dataset not well-suited to machine learning efforts
